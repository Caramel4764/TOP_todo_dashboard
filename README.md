## The Odin Project Todo
This was mainly practice working with localStorage, trying some new design ideas, grids. I usually try and speed through projects but I took my time with this one to really get most of what I'd like to implement.

### Additional things
I see little value in implementing features below because I likely won't benefit much and want to move on but if I come back to the project. I'd like to:
- Make todo menu look better
- Have Date use slash instead of dash
- Allow deletion of task rather than simply crossing them
- Order task from high, med, low, created new button, finished.
- Animation
